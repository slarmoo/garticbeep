                <p className="blob">Gartic Beep is similar to the game telephone. There will be five rounds each with two phases. In the first phase you will create a prompt, and then in the second phase you will design a short song based on that prompt. In the next round, you'll try to figure out what the original prompt of the song was, and then that gets sent to a new person to make a song based on that. In the last round you'll have a bit more time to create a song if you want to put a bit more effort into it. After everything is done, you'll get to see how prompts evolved over the event and all of the cool songs that came from it. </p>
